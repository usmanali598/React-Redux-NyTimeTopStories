## Fetching NYT TopStories with Redux

The app was successfully tried before with vanila JavaScript, React and with redux in a complicated way. However, this repository shows the shortest and easiest way to fetch api and use data according to the need with redux.

### `How to run the app:` 

```js
1. git clone https://github.com/usmanali598/ReduxFetchRedditApi.git
2. cd ReduxFetchRedditApi
3. npm install
4. npm start
```

### `About App:`

This app is basically fetching the images and text from reddit api and makes the image gallery. Images and text are updated after every minute so if there is new update in api then gallery will be updated accordingly. 

Moreover, animations are used as logo of cranework is hanging and moving. Similarly, border is created by covering all four sides on hovering any of the cards(image/text).
