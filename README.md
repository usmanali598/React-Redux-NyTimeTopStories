## Fetching NYT TopStories with Redux

The app was successfully tried before with vanila JavaScript, React and with redux in a complicated way. However, this repository shows the shortest and easiest way to fetch api and use data according to the need with redux.

### `How to run the app:` 

```js
1. git clone https://github.com/usmanali598/React-Redux-NyTimeTopStories.git
2. cd React-Redux-NyTimeTopStories
3. npm install
4. npm start
```

### `About App:`

This app is basically fetching the images and text from New York Times api. User can choose the topic and read the related top storis. Currently, I have put my api key that I will change later. Therefore, you could configure your own api key that is in reducer/fetchReducer > fetchPostsWithRedux method.
